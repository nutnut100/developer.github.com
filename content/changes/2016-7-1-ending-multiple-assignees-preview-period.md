We're making [Multiple Assignees][blog-post] part of the official GitHub API.

During the preview period you needed to provide the `application/vnd.github.cerberus-preview` preview media type in the `Accept` header to opt-in to the changes. Now that the preview period has ended, you no longer need to specify this custom media type.

If you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch with us][contact]!
